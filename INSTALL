Install mail-count
------------------

1. Download and unzip the archive to a temporary location.

2. Move the mail-count directory (containing logger.sh) to a desired location.
   
   example location: /home/sleddog/mail-count/
   
   Note that the logger.sh script will create (and delete) data files in this 
   directory. Don't put other stuff in there. Also note that PHP needs 
   read-access to this directory, so keep in mind any PHP access restrictions.  

3. Move the contents of the web directory (mail-count.php and mail-count.css)
   to a desired (web-accessible) location. The PHP & CSS files must be in the 
   same directory.

4. Open logger.sh in a text editor and enable either the Postfix or Exim4
   configuration. Check that the LOGFILE path is correct.

5. Make the script executable:

		chmod 700 logger.sh

6. Create a cronjob to run logger.sh periodically. The frequency is your choice.
   I use 15 minutes. The owner of the cronjob MUST have access to the mail log,
   so a root cronjob is the easy choice.

		*/15 * * * * /home/sleddog/mail-count/logger.sh

7. Open mail-count.php in a text editor and:

		1. Set the $datadir path (to the location of your mail-count directory).
		
		2. Set $interval to match the frequency of your cron job. This is
		minutes, so if your cronjob is hourly you'd set $interval = '60'.
		
8. Wait. Then browse to your mail-count.php.	

Additional:

You can configure actions for logger.sh based on two counters: 

		- Number of mails sent during the last cron interval
		- Number of mails sent in total today.
		
Or you can configure an action to take on the first run of each day.

See actions.example in the mail-count directory.
